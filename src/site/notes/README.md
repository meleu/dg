## Hi, I'm meleu! üëã

I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil (currently working in the DevOps field).

This is my üå± [[notes/digital garden\|digital garden]], therefore most of the contents is not "finished", but evolving over time.

I believe that **writing is thinking**, so the notes here are written to aid my thinking, learning and creating. I keep them public because [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) helps me to learn faster.

There are also some things that might be interesting to you, for example:

- üßë‚Äçüíª information [[about\|about]] me.
- üì∞ some [[moc/articles\|articles]] I write about nerdy things (sometimes in [[moc/artigos\|portuguese]]).
- üìö which [[moc/books\|books]] I've been reading (tech, fiction, non-fiction, whatever gets my interest).
- ‚åõ what I am focused on [[now\|now]].
- üß∞ the [[uses\|tools I use]] in my day-to-day life.

If you're curious enough to explore this garden, keep in mind that it can be a bilingual experience (English and Portuguese).
