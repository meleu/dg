# AWS Serverless

Resources to learn Serverless architecture using AWS.

Main technologies I'm interested in:

- AWS Lambda Functions
- AWS Step Functions
    - AWS State Language

## Studying

- [x] <https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-developer-introduction-aws-lambda/table-of-contents>
    - This is a great introductory course. A lot of important conceptual knowledge and good practices.
- [ ] [[notes/learning/AWS SAM Framework and AWS Lambda\|AWS SAM Framework and AWS Lambda]] - udemy
