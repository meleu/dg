# What I'm into *now*

My current focus is to have integrate TDD techniques in my workflow. Have it as a second nature. To achieve this I need to invest time in [[notes/TDD-Refactoring literature\|TDD-Refactoring literature]].


## Frequent Ideas

- Managing complexity: the software's primary technical imperative. ([[notes/books/code-complete/Code Complete\|Code Complete]])
- How to encourage co-workers to care about the quality of their work, despite business pressure? ([[notes/books/clean-code/Clean Code\|Clean Code]])
