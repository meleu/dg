# 2022-06

Things I did/learned in June of 2022:

- Started playing with BATS while doing the challenges proposed by Blau Araujo [here](https://codeberg.org/blau_araujo/tecnicas-do-shell/issues/22)
- Started taking my Personal Knowledge Management system more seriously:
    - read [[notes/books/Digital Zettelkasten - Principles, Methods, and Examples|Digital Zettelkasten - Principles, Methods, and Examples]]
    - started to spend more time curating my notes (instead of dumping more information on my system)
- Found a way to use my [[notes/Google Drive on Linux|Google Drive on Linux]]
- Read [[notes/books/Discurso sobre a servidão voluntária|Discurso sobre a servidão voluntária]]
- Started to read [[notes/books/Os 7 Hábitos das pessoas Altamente Eficazes|Os 7 Hábitos das pessoas Altamente Eficazes]]
